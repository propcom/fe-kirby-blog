KirbyCMS propBlog v0.1.2
===========

API with blog page to pull latest blog posts via AJAX. Drop in Isotope and everything becomes pretty.

Usage - 
	/blog-api/page:1 - change the number and you get latest posts on page 1, 11-20 on page 2... So on.
	/blog/ for hardcoded version for browsers that may not support AJAX. Pulls first 10 through.
	
	**SNIPPETS**
	There is a latestpost.php snippet - This pulls through and posts that have been marked to show on the front page.
